# Paper Title Generator

## Overview
This project is a Capstone Project for the Computer Understanding of Natural Language Processing class during the spring semester of 2023. The goal is to create a research paper title generator using the GPT-2 model. The model is trained on the arXiv dataset, which contains 30,000 abstracts of scientific research papers along with their titles.

## Features
- **GPT-2 Model**: Utilizes the GPT-2 model for generating research paper titles.
- **arXiv Dataset**: Trains the model on a dataset consisting of 30,000 abstracts and corresponding titles from scientific research papers.
- **Title Generation**: Generates new research paper titles based on input abstracts using the trained GPT-2 model.

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: Download and preprocess the arXiv dataset containing abstracts and titles of scientific research papers.
2. **Model Training**: Train the GPT-2 model using the preprocessed dataset.
3. **Title Generation**: Input abstracts to the trained model to generate corresponding research paper titles.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- Hugging Face's Transformers library
- arXiv dataset
